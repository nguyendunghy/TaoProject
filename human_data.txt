As covered by The Financial Brand, the first iteration of ‘banking by glass’ includes balance inquiry, the ability to get alerts and find branches and eventually deposit a check by looking at it. In addition, Westpac New Zealand has created the first SmartWatch banking app that leverages the bank’s Cash Tank application. Initially only providing balances without formal login, the application is expected to alsc include the ability to get alerts and do transfers in the future. It is clear that the development of innovative mobile banking applications is an ongoing process with new applications and capabilities being introduced almost every day. Therefore, it is important for those searching for digital banking nirvana to not only keep up with industry trends globally (much of the innovation is being done in the Asia Pacific region as mentioned in my recent blog post on innovation), but to also partner with those banks that have innovation ingrained in their culture. It is clear that many banks at Next Bank Sydney obviously do more than just talk the talk on innovation . . . they walk the walk.::0.03672834688352432The record spins around really fast, and the needle jumps into tehe groove and follows those lines that were drawn earlier.

However, some gamers have voiced their discontent with specific aspects related to the game's reception, which might include marketing, release timing or issues faced by players during launch. Overall, it is a game worth checking out despite these criticisms if you're into RPG games.::0.06006172757272946To find the measure of an angle of a regular polygon with 12 sides (a dodecagon), we can use the formula:

Angle measure (in degrees) = 180 * (number of sides - 2) / number of sides

Substituting 12 for both "number of sides" gives us:

Angle measure = 180 * 10 / 12

Angle measure = 150 degrees

Therefore, each interior angle of a regular dodecagon measures 150 degrees. Alternatively, we can also find the interior angle by dividing the total interior angles (360 degrees) by the number of sides:

Total interior angle = 360 degrees

Interior angle per side = Total interior angle / Number of sides

Interior angle per side = 360 / 12

Interior angle per side = 30 degrees

Each interior angle measures 30 degrees. However, since a regular polygon has rotational symmetry, we can also find the interior angles by finding any one angle and then multiplying it by the number of sides divided by two (since each vertex shares two interior angles). In our case, dividing 180 degrees by 2 gives us 90 degrees. Multiplying this by 6 (half the number of sides) gives us:

Interior angle = (Number of sides / 2)  90

Interior angle = 540 degrees

Total interior angle = 360 degrees

Subtracting the total interior angles from the total exterior angles (720 degrees) gives us:

Exterior angle per side = Total exterior angle / Number of sides

Exterior angle per side = 720 / 12

Exterior angle per side = 60 degrees

Each exterior angle measures 60 degrees.::0.8961200350121978This Vieux Chateau Du Roi wine making kit includes all the ingredients (juice, yeast and additives) you will need to make 6 gallons of wine, which is to about (30) 750mL bottles.

You would think you could be in and out of court with a settlement check in hand in no time. Unfortunately, this is the exception rather than the rule. No one likes to part with money, especially the insurance companies you usually deal with in a personal injury legal case. Those companies will do everything they can to keep you from getting the compensation to which you are entitled. This is especially frustrating if you have a serious injury, such as a broken leg or a ruptured disk. You need a way to finance your medical bills while you wait on a settlement offer on your slip and fall case, so you don’t feel pressured into taking the first low offer that comes along.

A = Pe(r/n)^(nt)

where A is the future value, P is the principal (iitial investment), e is the base of the natural logarithm, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times per year that interest is compounded, and t is the number of years. In your case, you have:

A = $3290
P = $3290
r = 6% per year
n = 1 (interest is compounded annually)
t = 6 years

So, plugging these values into the formula, we get:

A = 3290(1.06)^6

A = $5000.28

Therefore, the compound interest for $3290, 6% per year, over a period of 6 years is $1710.28.::0.869513683730835Let's apply this formula recursively to find T(19). We start by finding the values of T(18) and T(17):

T(18) = T(17) + T(16) + T(15)
T(17) = T(16) + T(15) + T(14)

Now, let's find the values of T(16), T(15), and T(14):

T(16) = T(15) + T(14) + T(13)
T(15) = T(14) + T(13) + T(12)
T(14) = T(13) + T(12) + T(11)

Continuing in this manner, we can find the values of all the Tribonacci numbers required to calculate T(19). Let's write out the entire sequence up to T(19):

T(0) = 0
T(1) = 0
T(2) = 1
T(3) = 1
T(4) = 1
T(5) = 3
T(6) = 5
T(7) = 13
T(8) = 21
T(9) = 34
T(10) = 55
T(11) = 89
T(12) = 144
T(13) = 233
T(14) = 377
T(15) = 610
T(16) = 987
T(17) = 157
T(18) = 2584
T(19) = ? ?? We've already filled in all the values up to T(18), so we can substitute these into our recursive formula for T(19):

T(19) = T(18) + T(17) + T(16)
T(19) = 2584 + 1597 + 987
T(19) = 4168

So, the 19th Tribonacci number is 4168!::0.9178140869943725Although the matrix is a work in progress, the effort to create it reflects a reality setting in among the nation’s counterterrorism ranks: The United States’ conventional wars are winding down, but the government expects to continue adding names to kill or capture lists for years... The administration has taken tentative steps toward greater transparency, formally acknowledging for the first time the United States’ use of armed drones. Less visible is the extent to which Obama has institutionalized the highly classified practice of targeted killing, transforming ad-hoc elements into a counterterrorism infrastructure capable of sustaining a seemingly permanent war. Spokesmen for the White House, the National Counterterrorism Center, the CIA and other agencies declined to comment on the matrix or other counterterrorism programs. Privately, officials acknowledge that the development of the matrix is part of a series of moves, in Washington and overseas, to embed counterterrorism tools into U.S. policy for the long haul. Miller's article details the streamlining of a "single, continually evolving [terrorist] database in which biographies, locations, known associates and affiliated organizations are all catalogued." The news of ever-growing kill lists comes the same week as the CIA's request to expand its drone fleet, further cementing the U.S.'s shift into permanent, covert war. Miller's report also reveals the unwavering surety among administration officials about the controversial counterterrorism programs as "bureaucratically, legally and morally nsound".

However, based on general trends and historical information, I can provide some insights into how access policies may have changed over time. From its opening in 2008 until now, there might have been changes to the entry requirements for accessing the private room at the SilverKris Lounge. Initially, only certain classes of passengers such as first or business class travelers, and frequent flyer program members may have had access to the lounge. Over time, airlines and airport authorities might have relaxed the entry requirements to make the lounge more accessible to a wider range of passengers. For example, som airlines may have expanded their membership programs to include more travelers or offered complimentary access to eligible passengers, while airports might have implemented a pay-per-use model for visitors who do not meet the initial criteria. These changes could be due to various factors such as competition among airlines and airport lounges, shifts in passenger demographics, or efforts to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty. It's important to note that specific entry requirements and policy changes would depend on the current date, the airline operating the flight, and any updates made by the airport authority since my knowledge was last updated in September 2021.::0.7543869047699217The information instead of livid watch please the housing!

According to folklorist Kunio Yanagita, the seasonal changes between yamawaro (field spirits) and kappa (mountain water sprites) are related to the division of faith in Japanese culture.

These spirits are revered and honored through offerings of food and drink at shrines and farmhouses, as well as through traditional rituals such as the bon dance festivals. However, during the winter months when the fields lie dormant and barren, the attention of farmers turns to the mountains, where kappa are said to reside.

But if we're talking about it, apparently his wife had no issue with it during their relationship and even found it endearing or a part of his "edgy" personality. However, during the recording sessions for his new album with Butch Walker, she apparently brought it up and mentioned that it might be worth getting fixed since they're trying to present a more polished image for the new music.

Mandler argued that this group, often seen as champions of liberal reforms, also held strong paternalistic beliefs, which influenced their approach to social issues and shaped the implementation of reforms.

Postmodernist literature often employs elements of pastiche, parody, and intertextuality, and may challenge conventional notions of linear time, causality, and authorship. Some key features of postmodernist literature include a heightened awareness of language and its limitations, an emphasis on the role of the reader in constructing meaning, and a rejection of clear-cut distinctions between fiction and reality. Postmodernist writers drew inspiration from various sources, including the philosophical theories of thinkers like Friedrich Nietzsche, Martin Heidegger, Jacques Derrida, and Jean Baudrillard, as well as cultural and historical events such as the Holocaust, the Cold War, and the rise of mass media and consumer culture. Some notable postmodernist writers include Don DeLillo, Thomas Pynchon, Virginia Woolf, Italo Calvino, Harold Pinter, and Samuel Beckett. Postmodernism is often seen as a reaction to the certainties and grand narratives of modernism, which sought to make sense of the complexities of the world through analysis and rational thought. Postmodernist writers, by contrast, embraced uncertainty, ambiguity, and the subjective nature of experience, and sought to challenge conventional ways of thinking about art, literature, and reality itself.::0.869513683730835He is a perfect little boy, and was just 1 week old when he visited my studio.

But when we swim, sometimes water gets into our mouths, noses, and ears accidentally. However, if you don't swallow the water or let it go in your nose or ears, your body won't get sick because these germs can only make us unwell if they enter our bodies and start growing there. So, when swimming, it's to keep water out of your mouth, nose, and ears as much as possible by holding your nose with your fingers, not swallowing the water, and keeping water out of your ears with earplugs or by tilting your head to let any water escape. That way, you can enjoy swimming without worrying about getting sick from the germs in the water!::0.8373297876455509I was shocked to hear Dr. Simmons say he had operated on a Tarlov Cyst patient!

We can change the denominator of 2/3 to 30 by multiplying both numerator and denominator by 10: 2/3  2 = 4/6 * 5 = 10/30. Now, we have 0.2 (decimal equivalent of 1/5) and 1/3 as our decimals to work with. To find the quotient:

Divide the decimal numbers as you would with whole numbers:

1. Divide the first digit in the decimal by each digit in the second decimal, carrying over if necessary (we don't have any digits in this example): 0 / 1 = 0.

Olsen and Robert Mair, a young potter who had arrived from New Zealand, were living near each other on the Dunmoochin Estate at Cottles Bridge near Hurstbridge, about 33 km north of Melbourne. The chance encounter of potter and artist produced a unique body of work over a period of two years, 1969-70, where Robert Mair produced a series of works, which were decorated by Olsen. The artist was stimulated by the possibilities of the calligraphic mark using glazes on earthenware, however, he was conscious of the difficulties faced with the unpredictability of the firing process. Olsen once wrote: 'I will allow the medium to speak on its own much more. I have found the glazes very unpredictable ... so one has to enter into the spirit of chance'. Over the ensuing years Olsen collaborated with a number of well-known ceramic artists, including Tom Sanders, Peter Wilson and, more recently Ros Auld, who crafted this plate. The striking forms produced by these potters coupled with the inventive designs created by Olsen, have made for a body of work which is often spontaneous, sometimes unconventional and certainly distinctive.

Boone Pickens calls for 100,000 wind turbines and 40,000 miles of new high-voltage (>230kV) transmission lines to be built in the Great Plains Region. The physical exposure of this infrastructure could compromise system security, however, as the bulk of new lines will need to be overhead transmission. Hendricks (2009) has suggested burying lines underground will improve Smart Grid’s security. Unfortunately, burying power lines is generally not feasible, as it mgkes them more susceptible to weather damage and slows repair time. Further, a 2006 study by the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) indicated putting power lines underground would cost about $1 million a mile compared with $100,000 to install overhead lines. EEI’s report, Out of Sight, Out of Mind?, estimated statewide initiatives to bury power lines could prompt electricity rate increases of 80 to 125%. There are at least four layers of physical security that must work to complement each other in Smart Grid: 1) environmental design 2) mechanical and electronic access control 3) intrusion detection and 4) video monitoring. EPRI and a number of US utilities are now discussing the possibility of monitoring transmission lines by satellite. Currently, this security measure is not practical because satellites with high-resolution imagery do not pass overhead often enough to pick up sabotage attempts, and those satellites passing more frequently lack the necessary imaging capability.::0.23122524750361578ECONOMYNEXT - The Export-Import Bank of South Korea has approved a zero interest loan of US$14 million for supply of garbage collection compactors to Sri Lanka to improve waste collection.

The project will provide 190 garbage compactors to local authorities in all nine provinces of Sri Lanka in order to collect and transfer large amount of waste to dumping sites in an efficient and economical manner. “Korea Eximbank which operate ECDF (Economic Development Cooperation Fund) entrusted by Korean Government will finance this project with a high concessional EDCF compact loan of 0% interest rate and 30 year repayment period including 10 year grace period,” the embassy said. The project executing agency will be the Ministry of Local Government and Provincial Council and Local Government and the National Solid Waste Management Centre under the purview of the same ministry will function as the project management unit. Following the tragic garbage dump collapse in Meethotamulla, the solid waste management becomes a pressing concern in Sri Lanka. “Currently, about 3/4 of solid wastes generated in urban areas are disposed through unsanitary open dumping due to the insufficiency of waste collection system,” the statement said. “In this context, this project will not only help prevent further environmental pollution and damage that was caused by unsanitary open dumping due to the insufficiency of waste collection system but will also enhance health and sanitary lifestyle of people in the long-run.

My mother, my dining companion, had a crab cake melt that was to be accented with a pistachio pesto and brie.::0.017271002420987818To find the angle measure of each side in a 15-sided polygon (also known as a pentadecagon), you can use the formula for the interior angles of a regular polygon:

Angle measure of each interior angle = 180° - (Number of sides x 180°/Number of sides)

Step 1: Identify the number of sides in your regular polygon. In this case, it's a regular 15-sided polygon. Step 2: Plug the values into the formula:

Angle measure of each interior angle = 180° - (15 x 180°/15)

Step 3: Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

Angle measure of each interior angle = 180° - (180°)

Step 4: Subtract:

Angle measure of each interior angle = 0°

Step 5: This result is incorrect as every polygon has an interior angle. The formula we used above is for the exterior angles of a regular polygon. For regular n-sided polygons, the sum of their exterior angles equals 360°. So let's find the exterior angle measure instead:

Exterior angle measure = Interior angle measure * 2

Step 6: Find the interior angle measure using the incorrect formula from Step 2:

Angle measure of each interior angle = 180° - (180°) = 0°

So, Exterior angle measure = 0° * 2 = 0°

This result is also incorrect.::0.8961200350121978March:

Here are the steps:
1. Find the total impedance (Z) for each phase with open-circuit test results:
   Z_O = R_Open + jX_Open
    where R_Open is the resistance and X_Open is the reactance of the open-circuit test results. 2. Now, find the total impedance (Z) for each phase with short-circuit test results:
   Z_S = R_Short + jX_Short
    where R_Short is the resistance and X_Short is the reactance of the short-circuit test results. 3. Compute the magnetizing reactances (M) for each phase using Clark's Postulates, which relate open-circuit and short-circuit impedances:
   M_O = √[(Z_S - Z_O)^2 + (Z_S^2 - Z_O^2)]
    where M_O is the magnetizing reactance of the open-circuit test results. 4. Calculate the direct synchronous reactances (x_d) for each phase:
   x_d = R_Short - M_O/3  (assuming symjmetrical three-phase system)
    where x_d is the direct synchronous reactance of a phase winding, and it is equal to the difference between the total resistance R_Short and the magnetizing reactance M_O divided by 3.::0.8373297876455509This house has approximately 1850 sq. ft. and includes free fiber-optic internet.

Country A cares about making sure everyone plays fairly, and it wants to help all kids be on the playground. However, it's not easy to just take away Country B's toys without causing problems. They might get angry or try to get back at Country A by taking other things from them too. Country A has tried talking nicely with Country B and even shared some of their own toys, but Country B keeps being mean to others on the playground.

It revolves around the protagonist, who is a high school girl named Yoshiko. She is struggling with her identity and trying to find her place in society. The story explores themes such as alienation, self-discovery, and social pressure. On the other hand, "Bokura no Mura ni wa Mizuumi ga Atta" takes place in a small town in rural Japan over the course of several years. It focuses on the lives of four high school friends who remain close throughout their lives but face different challenges as they grow older. The story explores themes such as friendship, love, family, and the passage of time. In terms of plotlines, "Boku ga Gomi wo Suteta Riyuu" is more focused on Yoshiko's internal struggles and her relationships with her friends and family, while "Bokura no Mura ni wa Mizuumi ga Atta" follows the four friends as they navigate different stages of their lives. Overall, both works deal with themes of self-discovery and personal growth, but "Bokura no Mura ni wa Mizuumi ga Atta" is more expansive in its scope, exploring not only the characters' individual experiences but also the impact of time on their relationships and community. In terms of Yumi Tamura's writing style, both works are characterized by her attention to detail and ability to capture the nuances of human emotions.::0.8373297876455509Sure, here's the answer:

To find the value of y in the system of equations:

1. Rearrange the first equation to isolate y:

$4x - 5y = 69

-5y = 69 - 4x

$y = (69 - 4x) / -5

2. Substitute this expression for y into the second equation:

$2x - 9y = 93

$2x - 9((69 - 4x) / -5) = 93

3. Solve for x:

$2x - 9(69 - 4x) = 93

$2x - 651 - 36x = 93

-34x = 651 - 93 = 558

-34x = 558

x = 558 / -34 = -17

4. Now that we have the value of x, we can find the value of y:

$y = (69 - 4x) / -5

$y = (69 - 4(-17)) / -5

$y = 11

Therefore, the value of y in the system of equtions is 11.::0.8961200350121978ST. PATRICK’S DAY!

Here's a simple explanation: Just like how we humans shoes to protect our feet from the cold, rough ground or sharp objects, dogs don't naturally need shoes since their paw pads can handle most surfaces. When we put shoes on them, it feels different and strange for their sensitive paws. They might try to shake their feet or walk awkwardly as they adjust to this new sensation.

This means they can move quickly and easily from place to place, which is important in emergencies or unexpected situations. Some people might argue that the Army or Navy could potentially fulfill the Marine Corps' role, but there are a few key differences:

- The Marines are trained differently than other branches of the military, focusing more on infantry (ground troops) and amphibious operations. This makes them particularly skilled at these tasks. - The Marines have their own unique equipment and resources, such as special vehicles designed for amphibious landings or quick reactions to emergency situations. - The Marines are organized differently than other branches, with a focus on smaller, more self-sufficient units that can operate independently in the field. This allows them to be more flexible and adaptable in different situations. So while all branches of the military have important roles to play in keeping our country safe, the Marine Corps has a unique mission that helps ensure we're always prepared for whatever comes our way.::0.8373297876455509A man named Akira checks into the hotel with a woman, Chizuko.

   - x2 = -15
   - y2 = -11

One chamber would have less air than the other, so the air in the high-pressure chamber would rush into the low-pressure chamber, and this movement of air would push a piston and turn a wheel, generating work. However, here's why it doesn't work:
1. Energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only change from one form to another. 2. The energy needed to keep the air moving in the machine comes from the difference in pressure between the two chambers. But as the air moves back and forth, its pressure will eventually even out, meaning there won't be enough energy left for the machine to keep running. 3.::0.7543869047699217"Brad also arrived alone in a baseball cap".

   Derivative: d/dx [6x] = 6  d/dx [x] = 6 * 1 = 6

2. The second term is 6x^3
   Derivative: d/dx [6x^3] = 6  d/dx [x^3] = 6  x^(3-1) = 18x^2

3. The third term is 9x^3
   Derivative: d/dx [9x^3] = 9  d/dx [x^3] = 9  x^(3-1) = 27x^2

Now, find the sum of these derivatives to get the overall derivative:

f'(x) = 6 + 18x^2 + 27x^2

Substitute x = 13 in this expression to find the value of f'(13):

f'(13) = 6 + 18(13)^2 + 27(13)^2

Their function is uncertain, as well, but they might play a role in camouflage or intraspecific communication. As for the hindwings, Gymnobathra callixyla have translucent greyish-brown to pale brown forewings, while their hindwings are plainly darker and more opaque with no distinctive patterns. The wing structure of this moth helps in its flight and camouflage against their environment. To summarize, the main differences in forewing coloration and markings between male and female gymnobathra callixyla involve potential variation in intensity or width of the longitudinal yellow-ochreous streak.::0.1885318316059698The line is called the "signature line," and it's where you usually sign your name at the bottom of a document, like a check or an agreement. But in this case, therxe's a special rule that says you can't write, sign, or stamp anything below that line because it's reserved for financial institutions to use. This is called a "no-signature space," and it's often used in documents where financial institutions need extra room to add their own information, like account numbers or routing codes.

If we're referring to the meaning of 'speech' or 'word', then one of the most common Kanji combinations used for that would be 語 (pronounced as 'koto'). However, if you're specifically talking about language study, such as learning and teaching languages, another commonly-used term in Japan would be 言語学習 (pronounced as 'gengogaku-shuu'), which means "language education" or "linguistics". It is composed of multiple Kanji: 言語 (koto, speech/word), 学習 (shuu, study) and 研究 (kenkyuu, research).::0.7543869047699217The Senate also passes a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, with a simple majority vote since the Republicans would control both chambers. 3. The bills go to President Romney for signing into law. He will sign them because he has expressed his intention to repeal Obamacare. 4. However, the Affordable Care Act is a complex piece of legislation, and simply repealing it without replacing it with something else would cause major disruptions in the healthcare system. Therefore, Congress may need mo pass additional bills to address the transitional issues that arise from repeal. 5.::0.5223494462447779I apologize if my previous response was not satisfactory.

Regarding your question about the Muhammad Ali vs. Joe Frazier boxing match on October 1, 1975, I can tell you that it was a significant event in boxing history. The fight, also known as the "Thrulla in Manila," was held at the Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City, Philippines, and is considered one of the greatest boxing matches of all time. The bout was a 12-round championship match for Ali's World Heavyweight Championship, and Frazier entered as the reigning champion. The fight was highly anticipated due to the intense rivalry between the two boxers, with each having won several bouts against one another leading up to the match. The fight itself was a closely contested battle that saw both boxers giving their all. In the end, Ali emerged victorious, winning by technical knockout in the 14th round.::0.869513683730835She summed up the general mood of those we spoke to: "If it is medicinal and it's genuinely going to help people tyen I don't have a problem with it." A run-down Conservative Party Association club sits front and centre on the high street opposite the Barclays, next to which is a Greggs. These parts are staunchly Tory, seemingly more by habit than conviction, and the MP for South West Norfolk has been a Tory since 1964. Liz Truss, the current member of parliament for the area, became embroiled in the smell saga last year and accompanied a group of concerned residents on a visit to the factory to help dispel the mystique. However, the cannabis had been harvested and processed by the time the local delegation visited, meaning the smell was barely still lingering. It was much the same when we visited: from a vantage point on top of a grass verge adjacent to the greenhouse, we discovered what was essentially a bare vineyard. The plant is grown and harvested according to 16-week cycles, and we had apparently just missed our chance of catching the crop in full bloom. Of course, security wouldn't have let us in to get a closer look anyway; they weren't too happy we had even tried to sneak a peek from outside. After it eventually emerged that the stench-wave was caused by its first cannabis harvest, British Sugar promised it was looking at measures to "reduce the intensity and impact" on its neighbours in the future.::0.04703823524565933A Commonwealth state is a country that is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, which is an international organization made up of fifty-four independent states, most formerly part of the British Empire.

This boosted the local oil production in Texas, including areas such as Midland County where Plateau is situated.

It's like a baker's helper! The sleeve helps keep the dough inside the Hot Pocket from getting too soft or sticky, and it also makes it easier to get the Hot Pocket out of the oven once it's done cooking. If you don't use a Hot Pocket Sleeve, the dough can stick to the sides of the oven and make a mess. And if you try to pull the Hot Pocket out by the edges, it can get crushed or broken. But with a sleeve, you can just lift it out by the handle, and everything stays nice and So, even though you might not need a sleeve for every Hot Pocket you cook, it's a good idea to use one if you want your Hot Pockets to come out looking and tasting their best.::0.8373297876455509
