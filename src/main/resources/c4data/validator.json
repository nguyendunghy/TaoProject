{"text":"The presentation of Saß’ long awaited, comprehensive work about the legendary music venue “Quartier Latin” gives occasion for an evening of live music and readings. One of the best-know rock, jazz, and blues stages of West Berlin, the new Wintergarten Varieté now occupies the walls of the “Quartier Latin” and will celebrate its precursor with an evening to remember.\nThe evening: Long, overcrowded nights, memorable events, strange stories, but also adversity, crises and ever new solutions. The “Quartier Latin” is brought back to life for a multimedial evening on the very stage that hosted a wild flurry of musicians and artists for almost twenty years during the wild Westberliner years. Through conversation and song, readings and multivisions, the authors of the book will commemorate artists and organisers, operators, guests and all others that worked to give the “Quartier Latin” its unique place in Berlin’s history.\nThe book: A mixture of image and text, with a large number of authentic photographs, documents, impressions and memories on 400 pages; An opulent picture book for friends of the legendary Quartier Latin and all who are curious about the vibrant rock and jazz history of the cultural and counter-cultural metropolis Berlin. With a lot of sympathy for its subject, the book utilizes images, documentation and text to conjure the legendary music venue and its heyday of the 1970s and 80s.\nThe authors: As the son of managers Christa and Manfred “Manne” Saß, Marco Saß experienced the Latin Quarter more directly than anyone else during his teenage years, and captured a wealth of impressions of the popular music venue via classic black&white concert photography. Henry Steinhau, music journalist and cultural editor, experienced more than 100 concerts at the “Quartier Latin” in the 1980s. With a relaxed, cheeky style, he leads through stories and history, narratives and stories, combining experiences and insights. Erik Spiekermann, internationally renowned designer and type designer from Berlin provides the book’s design. Well-known for creating numerous typefaces, such as the modern classic Meta and the BVG house font, as well as founding the international design agencies Metadesign and EdenSpiekermann, Spiekermann was also involved with the “Quartier Latin” in the 1970s. Through his experiences as a musician, designer, and printer of concert posters for the venue, Spiekermann was able to provide a very special contribution that is reflected in the loving design of the book.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T20:26:05Z","url":"https://www.wintergarten-berlin.de/en/show/quartier-latin/"}

They were held without charge for weeks and then transferred to Kinshasa's main prison where they remain.\nIn June last year they were charged with belonging to an association formed to attack people and property, plotting a conspiracy against the head of state, and attempting to either destroy or change the constitutional regime or incite violence against the state.","timestamp":"2019-04-26T01:53:04Z","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3499289/Detained-activists-hunger-strike-DR-Congo.html"}

{"text":"EMPEROR penguins may go into decline this century, as global warming melts the sea ice they rely on. But they might survive by moving to new breeding grounds.\nThe world’s 600,000 emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) live in 45 colonies around Antarctica. Only one colony, at Adélie Land, has been studied in detail.\nHal Caswell at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts and his colleagues used data from Adélie Land to predict what will happen to all emperors. They projected how global warming until 2100 will affect each colony’s sea ice. Too much ice forces the birds to travel greater distances to the ocean to find food for their young, but too little means less krill, one of their main food sources, because sea ice is the krill’s habitat.\nBy 2040 the retreating sea ice will cause all of the penguin colonies to shrink. The population may fall 19 per cent by 2100 (Nature Climate Change, doi.org/tgj).\n“If emperor penguin colonies were bank accounts, they would all be showing negative returns by the end of the century,” says Caswell.\nBut if the penguins move to new homes, they have a better chance. And they do move, says Michelle LaRue at the University of Minnesota at St Paul. She tracked colonies using satellites and found six instances when the penguins didn’t return to the same location to breed. She also found a new colony on the Antarctic Peninsula.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T08:14:01Z","url":"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22329763-200-melting-ice-puts-emperor-penguins-on-a-slippery-slope/"}
{"text":"In a mid-December Eurasia Review op-ed piece, Allan C. Brownfeld critiqued Tesla as being little more than “Elon Musks’s [sic] Taxpayer-Funded Gravy Train.” Is this accurate? Is Tesla using taxpayer dollars to create a series of businesses? And, if so, are any of the contracts, incentives, or loans of which Tesla has taken advantage illegal or unethical? Let’s play “Tesla and the Taxpayer: True or False” to figure this out, shall we?\nTesla & the Taxpayer: True or False?\nIt’s a matter of public record that Tesla is an all-electric car company and has associated auto manufacturing and battery factories. As part of its sustainable energy ecosystem, Tesla manufactures the Powerwall, Powerpack, and solar roofs.\nElon Musk also leads Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX), where he oversees the development and manufacturing of advanced rockets and spacecraft for missions to and beyond Earth’s orbit. Musk is one of the founders of Neuralink as well, which is developing ultra-high-bandwidth brain-machine interfaces to connect humans and computers, and the The Boring Company, which has a goal to increase tunneling speed and drop costs by a factor of 10 or more.\nWhich of the following statements about Tesla is true or false?\nTesla spends $1 million annually on Washington lobbyists. T or F?\nTesla has received $280 million in federal tax incentives. T or F?\nSpaceX has received over $5 billion in government support. T or F?\nThe state of New York hasn’t seen the 1,500 jobs it signed up for in exchange for $750 million. T or F?\nBrownfield’s argument seems to come down to Tesla “has over promised and under delivered.” Let’s see.\nTrue. According to opensecrets.org, Tesla’s total declared lobbying expenditures for 2018 were $700,000, and this investigative site says another $355,00 can be traced to Tesla, although those expenditures have not yet been reported by the company. The $1 million figure that Brownfield cited is also accurate for 2017.\nSo, what’s Tesla lobbying for with this cash? Some of the 2018 legislation for which Tesla has advocated includes the Truck Technology Parity Act, the SELF DRIVE Act, the Department of Transportation Appropriations Act, the Fuel Economy Harmonization Act, the Energy Storage Tax Incentive and Deployment Act, and the Electric Credit Access Ready at Sale Act. Each of these seems to be consistent with Tesla’s business goals to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. Tesla is intent on creating a business climate in which people don’t need to compromise to drive electric.\nAnd what about other automakers? Do they have comparable lobbying expenditures to Tesla?\nSo, Tesla is in good company when it comes to lobbying efforts, and, indeed, is at the lower end.\nAnd what about fossil fuel companies that support the auto industry? In 2015, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reported that fossil fuel companies are benefiting from global subsidies of $5.3 trillion (£3.4 trillion) a year, equivalent to $10 million per minute every day. Check out this graphic below for 2018! Although the oil and gas industry lobbying is only partially devoted to the automobile industry, it’s still mind-blowing!\nMaybe he means the federal electric vehicle (EV) tax credit? But it applies to the first 200,000 electric vehicles sold by a manufacturer and is, thereafter, phased out. Also, the tax credit doesn’t go to Tesla — it is part of the customer’s total equation when considering purchasing an EV.\nThe Washington Post has reported that Tesla “has relied heavily on a California zero-emissions scheme that in 2017 amounted to a $280 million subsidy.” Maybe that’s what Brownfeld was suggesting. The Post’s word choices certainly are filled with negative connotations (“relied heavily,” “scheme,” amounted to”), and those ideas are open for debate. But for the sake of brevity, California did not write its legislation to benefit Tesla, and other auto manufacturers surely could have taken advantage of the California zero-emissions opportunity that was waiting there for them.\nDear Mr. Brownfeld: California is a state, and its legislation in not part of a federal agenda. So, Tesla did not receive $280 million in federal tax incentives.\nTesla paid off the loan 9 years earlier than required, as we reported 5½ years ago.\nFirst of all, let’s recognize that SpaceX is a completely separate company from Tesla. Anyhow, Mr. Brownfeld brought it up, so we’ll cover it.\nIn March 2018, the US Air Force awarded SpaceX with a new $291 million contract. It also awarded ULA $355 million in contracts. That’s according to CNBC. And SpaceX broke its own record for the most orbital rocket launches by a single company in a year, according to Business Insider. In 2018, Elon Musk’s aerospace company achieved 20 successful launches. Those missions sent dozens of payloads into orbit, debuted two experimental Starlink internet satellites, and shot a car past the orbit of Mars. Does it seem to you that the taxpayers — in an era of privatization of former government divisions — got its money’s worth?\nI read through that NASA report, and it seems as if, acting from previous findings, SpaceX was able to recreate a buckle event during a COPV test. Using the data, SpaceX modified its helium loading configuration, process, and controls to ensure that the COPVs would not be exposed to these identified conditions and, accepting any residual risk, successfully resumed commercial launches with the existing COPV design. SpaceX didn’t stop there, however. To further improve safety and reduce the risk for missions with crew onboard, SpaceX redesigned the COPV so NASA could test and characterize the behavior of the new COPV in the cryogenic oxygen environment.\nWhy is all this important? This is the most critical step in clearing the COPV for human space flight, as it allows NASA and SpaceX to identify the credible failure mechanisms, hazard scenarios and controls, as well as understand the safety margins on the system (p. 16). SpaceX is part of NASA’s effort to have people able to travel in space. Of course, it makes sense that constant reevaluation and updates would need to occur.\nTrue — but the contractual end date isn’t in sight yet, either. Brownfeld cites a Bloomberg Business News report from November 2018 about Tesla’s Buffalo solar factory. Saying that “only a relative handful of jobs have been created, and New York officials are expressing dismay,” Brownfeld looks to Raymond Walter, a Republican in the New York State Assembly, who says he is concerned that the state “has too many eggs in the Tesla basket, which doesn’t seem like a very strong basket.” As I say to my undergrads, where’s the data to make that claim?\nBloomberg News goes on to say this is “a familiar playbook for Musk, start with wild promises followed by product delays, production hell, shareholder anger and finally, hopefully, redemption.” What Brownfeld fails to mention is another quote in Bloomberg News: “Musk assumed an optimistic note in a recent earnings call, boasting of his ‘best quarter ever for solar” in terms of profitability, while assuring shareholders that Tesla would accelerate Solar Roof production in 2019. If he’s right, he’ll vindicate Cuomo’s bet on the company and maybe even make Buffalo great again.” The distaste for appropriating a horrible allusion aside, the article concludes on a note of balance, adding that tech companies may lose the confidence of local governments if Tesla’s New York solar ventures fail. So it’s a, “we’ll see, won’t we?” attitude.\nYes, Tesla must employ 1,460 workers at the facility by 2020 as part of the ramp up to 5,000 employees in the state within 10 years. These targets will definitely test the solar division of Tesla, one that is under redesign and substantial internal examination. As with the Model 3 production, it seems likely a balance of automation and human labor will stimulate the production of its Solar Roof Tiles in quantity and quality to meet rising consumer demand.\nAlmost all of the supposed Tesla subsidization suggested by Brownfeld has occurred as part of broad programs available to essentially every qualified company out there. Brownfeld, a former U.S. Senate staffer and consultant to the Vice President, neglected to mention The Boring Company in his diatribe, which is privately funded, and its individual projects are privately funded as well.\nTesla has been ahead of schedule on the deliverables of its Nevada Gigafactory, and was ahead of schedule paying back a federal government loan (other automakers also got loans from that governmental program). Tesla has put traditional car companies like GM and Ford in catch-up mode, and is now worth more than both of them. Tesla has shown it can profitably make a mass-market car at scale.

Because we are specialized, we can deliver quality treatment results in very efficient manner. We work with other specialists in dental fields such as pediatric dentists, oral surgeons, periodontists, and general dentists to achieve smiles for our patients that are both healthy and beautiful.\nAlthough the majority of patients receive orthodontic treatment in their early teens, some dental conditions are best corrected at an earlier age to prevent major problems from developing in the future. The American Association of Orthodontists recommends that your child get an orthodontic check-up at age 7.\nTwo phase orthodontic treatment consists of two separate times when a child receives treatment. A first phase of treatment is done while the child still has many of their primary teeth. The first phase addresses issues that are easier and more effective to treat at a younger age and often creates space for adult teeth to erupt. A second phase takes place when the child as most or all of their permanent teeth. Braces may or may not be used during a first phase of treatment. Between the two phases there is usually a waiting period while the teeth erupt.\nAdolescence is usually the ideal time for patients to receive orthodontic treatment. Most common problems such as crowding and minor bite issues are corrected at this age. The rapid growth that occurs during adolescence can be used to correct a variety of dental and skeletal problems. Once the bones have fully developed, certain conditions can only be fully corrected with surgical assistance.\nOrthodontic treatment for adults can range from treating relapse after previous orthodontics to treatment for those who have never had orthodontics before. Adults have many options such as metal braces, ceramic braces, or clear removable aligners. There is no age limit for orthodontics.\nCertain cases cannot be fully corrected without surgical procedures. Severe jaw discrepancies may require jaw surgery in conjunction with braces. These cases involve a team effort between Dr. Jones and an oral surgeon. Surgical options should not be taken lightly, but the results often show dramatic aesthetic and functional improvements.\nClear aligners are a great option for teens and adults. Aligners are changed at home by the patient and are removed for meals. Clear aligners are a great aesthetic treatment option.\nThere are several appliances which modify the shape and position of the facial bones such as expanders, MARAs, and facemasks. These appliances are often used in conjunction with braces to achieve dramatic results.\nThumb sucking habits, tongue thrust habits, and lip sucking habits can cause significant changes in the dentition. Appliances can help disrupt harmful oral habits on their own or as a part of comprehensive orthodontic treatment.\nRetainers are used to hold teeth in place after treatment is completed. Consistent retainer wear will guarantee that the teeth remain in their corrected positions. Our office offers acrylic hawley retainers, clear essix retainers, and bonded retainers.\nThe iTero scanner uses a small camera to create digital models of teeth and bites. The scanner replaces the need for messy impressions. It can be used for study models, appliances, and clear aligners.\nCeramic braces are a great alternative to traditional braces for patients seeking a more aesthetic treatment option.

{"text":"xThe presentation of Saß’ long awaited, comprehensive work about the legendary music venue “Quartier Latin” gives occasion for an evening of live music and readings. One of the best-know rock, jazz, and blues stages of West Berlin, the new Wintergarten Varieté now occupies the walls of the “Quartier Latin” and will celebrate its precursor with an evening to remember.\nThe evening: Long, overcrowded nights, memorable events, strange stories, but also adversity, crises and ever new solutions. The “Quartier Latin” is brought back to life for a multimedial evening on the very stage that hosted a wild flurry of musicians and artists for almost twenty years during the wild Westberliner years. Through conversation and song, readings and multivisions, the authors of the book will commemorate artists and organisers, operators, guests and all others that worked to give the “Quartier Latin” its unique place in Berlin’s history.\nThe book: A mixture of image and text, with a large number of authentic photographs, documents, impressions and memories on 400 pages; An opulent picture book for friends of the legendary Quartier Latin and all who are curious about the vibrant rock and jazz history of the cultural and counter-cultural metropolis Berlin. With a lot of sympathy for its subject, the book utilizes images, documentation and text to conjure the legendary music venue and its heyday of the 1970s and 80s.\nThe authors: As the son of managers Christa and Manfred “Manne” Saß, Marco Saß experienced the Latin Quarter more directly than anyone else during his teenage years, and captured a wealth of impressions of the popular music venue via classic black&white concert photography. Henry Steinhau, music journalist and cultural editor, experienced more than 100 concerts at the “Quartier Latin” in the 1980s. With a relaxed, cheeky style, he leads through stories and history, narratives and stories, combining experiences and insights. Erik Spiekermann, internationally renowned designer and type designer from Berlin provides the book’s design. Well-known for creating numerous typefaces, such as the modern classic Meta and the BVG house font, as well as founding the international design agencies Metadesign and EdenSpiekermann, Spiekermann was also involved with the “Quartier Latin” in the 1970s. Through his experiences as a musician, designer, and printer of concert posters for the venue, Spiekermann was able to provide a very special contribution that is reflected in the loving design of the book.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T20:26:05Z","url":"https://www.wintergarten-berlin.de/en/show/quartier-latin/"}

{"text":"EMPEROR penguins may go into decline this century, as global warming melts the sea ice they rely on. But they might survive by moving to new breeding grounds.\nThe world’s 600,000 emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) live in 45 colonies around Antarctica. Only one colony, at Adélie Land, has been studied in detail.\nHal Caswell at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts and his colleagues used data from Adélie Land to predict what will happen to all emperors. They projected how global warming until 2100 will affect each colony’s sea ice. Too much ice forces the birds to travel greater distances to the ocean to find food for their young, but too little means less krill, one of their main food sources, because sea ice is the krill’s habitat.\nBy 2040 the retreating sea ice will cause all of the penguin colonies to shrink. The population may fall 19 per cent by 2100 (Nature Climate Change, doi.org/tgj).\n“If emperor penguin colonies were bank accounts, they would all be showing negative returns by the end of the century,” says Caswell.\nBut if the penguins move to new homes, they have a better chance. And they do move, says Michelle LaRue at the University of Minnesota at St Paul. She tracked colonies using satellites and found six instances when the penguins didn’t return to the same location to breed. She also found a new colony on the Antarctic Peninsula.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T08:14:01Z","url":"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22329763-200-melting-ice-puts-emperor-penguins-on-a-slippery-slope/"}
{"text":"In a mid-December Eurasia Review op-ed piece, Allan C. Brownfeld critiqued Tesla as being little more than “Elon Musks’s [sic] Taxpayer-Funded Gravy Train.” Is this accurate? Is Tesla using taxpayer dollars to create a series of businesses? And, if so, are any of the contracts, incentives, or loans of which Tesla has taken advantage illegal or unethical? Let’s play “Tesla and the Taxpayer: True or False” to figure this out, shall we?\nTesla & the Taxpayer: True or False?\nIt’s a matter of public record that Tesla is an all-electric car company and has associated auto manufacturing and battery factories. As part of its sustainable energy ecosystem, Tesla manufactures the Powerwall, Powerpack, and solar roofs.\nElon Musk also leads Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX), where he oversees the development and manufacturing of advanced rockets and spacecraft for missions to and beyond Earth’s orbit. Musk is one of the founders of Neuralink as well, which is developing ultra-high-bandwidth brain-machine interfaces to connect humans and computers, and the The Boring Company, which has a goal to increase tunneling speed and drop costs by a factor of 10 or more.\nWhich of the following statements about Tesla is true or false?\nTesla spends $1 million annually on Washington lobbyists. T or F?\nTesla has received $280 million in federal tax incentives. T or F?\nSpaceX has received over $5 billion in government support. T or F?\nThe state of New York hasn’t seen the 1,500 jobs it signed up for in exchange for $750 million. T or F?\nBrownfield’s argument seems to come down to Tesla “has over promised and under delivered.” Let’s see.\nTrue. According to opensecrets.org, Tesla’s total declared lobbying expenditures for 2018 were $700,000, and this investigative site says another $355,00 can be traced to Tesla, although those expenditures have not yet been reported by the company. The $1 million figure that Brownfield cited is also accurate for 2017.\nSo, what’s Tesla lobbying for with this cash? Some of the 2018 legislation for which Tesla has advocated includes the Truck Technology Parity Act, the SELF DRIVE Act, the Department of Transportation Appropriations Act, the Fuel Economy Harmonization Act, the Energy Storage Tax Incentive and Deployment Act, and the Electric Credit Access Ready at Sale Act. Each of these seems to be consistent with Tesla’s business goals to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. Tesla is intent on creating a business climate in which people don’t need to compromise to drive electric.\nAnd what about other automakers? Do they have comparable lobbying expenditures to Tesla?\nSo, Tesla is in good company when it comes to lobbying efforts, and, indeed, is at the lower end.\nAnd what about fossil fuel companies that support the auto industry? In 2015, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reported that fossil fuel companies are benefiting from global subsidies of $5.3 trillion (£3.4 trillion) a year, equivalent to $10 million per minute every day. Check out this graphic below for 2018! Although the oil and gas industry lobbying is only partially devoted to the automobile industry, it’s still mind-blowing!\nMaybe he means the federal electric vehicle (EV) tax credit? But it applies to the first 200,000 electric vehicles sold by a manufacturer and is, thereafter, phased out. Also, the tax credit doesn’t go to Tesla — it is part of the customer’s total equation when considering purchasing an EV.\nThe Washington Post has reported that Tesla “has relied heavily on a California zero-emissions scheme that in 2017 amounted to a $280 million subsidy.” Maybe that’s what Brownfeld was suggesting. The Post’s word choices certainly are filled with negative connotations (“relied heavily,” “scheme,” amounted to”), and those ideas are open for debate. But for the sake of brevity, California did not write its legislation to benefit Tesla, and other auto manufacturers surely could have taken advantage of the California zero-emissions opportunity that was waiting there for them.\nDear Mr. Brownfeld: California is a state, and its legislation in not part of a federal agenda. So, Tesla did not receive $280 million in federal tax incentives.\nTesla paid off the loan 9 years earlier than required, as we reported 5½ years ago.\nFirst of all, let’s recognize that SpaceX is a completely separate company from Tesla. Anyhow, Mr. Brownfeld brought it up, so we’ll cover it.\nIn March 2018, the US Air Force awarded SpaceX with a new $291 million contract. It also awarded ULA $355 million in contracts. That’s according to CNBC. And SpaceX broke its own record for the most orbital rocket launches by a single company in a year, according to Business Insider. In 2018, Elon Musk’s aerospace company achieved 20 successful launches. Those missions sent dozens of payloads into orbit, debuted two experimental Starlink internet satellites, and shot a car past the orbit of Mars. Does it seem to you that the taxpayers — in an era of privatization of former government divisions — got its money’s worth?\nI read through that NASA report, and it seems as if, acting from previous findings, SpaceX was able to recreate a buckle event during a COPV test. Using the data, SpaceX modified its helium loading configuration, process, and controls to ensure that the COPVs would not be exposed to these identified conditions and, accepting any residual risk, successfully resumed commercial launches with the existing COPV design. SpaceX didn’t stop there, however. To further improve safety and reduce the risk for missions with crew onboard, SpaceX redesigned the COPV so NASA could test and characterize the behavior of the new COPV in the cryogenic oxygen environment.\nWhy is all this important? This is the most critical step in clearing the COPV for human space flight, as it allows NASA and SpaceX to identify the credible failure mechanisms, hazard scenarios and controls, as well as understand the safety margins on the system (p. 16). SpaceX is part of NASA’s effort to have people able to travel in space. Of course, it makes sense that constant reevaluation and updates would need to occur.\nTrue — but the contractual end date isn’t in sight yet, either. Brownfeld cites a Bloomberg Business News report from November 2018 about Tesla’s Buffalo solar factory. Saying that “only a relative handful of jobs have been created, and New York officials are expressing dismay,” Brownfeld looks to Raymond Walter, a Republican in the New York State Assembly, who says he is concerned that the state “has too many eggs in the Tesla basket, which doesn’t seem like a very strong basket.” As I say to my undergrads, where’s the data to make that claim?\nBloomberg News goes on to say this is “a familiar playbook for Musk, start with wild promises followed by product delays, production hell, shareholder anger and finally, hopefully, redemption.” What Brownfeld fails to mention is another quote in Bloomberg News: “Musk assumed an optimistic note in a recent earnings call, boasting of his ‘best quarter ever for solar” in terms of profitability, while assuring shareholders that Tesla would accelerate Solar Roof production in 2019. If he’s right, he’ll vindicate Cuomo’s bet on the company and maybe even make Buffalo great again.” The distaste for appropriating a horrible allusion aside, the article concludes on a note of balance, adding that tech companies may lose the confidence of local governments if Tesla’s New York solar ventures fail. So it’s a, “we’ll see, won’t we?” attitude.\nYes, Tesla must employ 1,460 workers at the facility by 2020 as part of the ramp up to 5,000 employees in the state within 10 years. These targets will definitely test the solar division of Tesla, one that is under redesign and substantial internal examination. As with the Model 3 production, it seems likely a balance of automation and human labor will stimulate the production of its Solar Roof Tiles in quantity and quality to meet rising consumer demand.\nAlmost all of the supposed Tesla subsidization suggested by Brownfeld has occurred as part of broad programs available to essentially every qualified company out there. Brownfeld, a former U.S. Senate staffer and consultant to the Vice President, neglected to mention The Boring Company in his diatribe, which is privately funded, and its individual projects are privately funded as well.\nTesla has been ahead of schedule on the deliverables of its Nevada Gigafactory, and was ahead of schedule paying back a federal government loan (other automakers also got loans from that governmental program). Tesla has put traditional car companies like GM and Ford in catch-up mode, and is now worth more than both of them. Tesla has shown it can profitably make a mass-market car at scale. It is an American success story in the business world that should theoretically get high praise from Republicans and Democrats alike.\nThe conservatives who are at risk of losing hegemonic control of the global energy sector will likely continue to produce ample negative targeted messaging about Tesla, which often neglects to include many important facts and chooses language specifically intended to discredit Tesla without foundation. The war on Tesla may be here for a while longer.\nOur own Zachary Shahan captured it well in October as he tried to understand why large members of the media are participating in The Tesla Smear and why so many reporters and editors are acting as pawns of billionaire short sellers, the oil industry, and the broader auto industry. His analysis suggests that media animus like Brownfeld’s rants may become more rare as Tesla communicates its whole story to reporters who are “strapped for time and continuously being fed buffets of short-seller talking points.” Fingers crossed.","timestamp":"2019-04-23T22:38:48Z","url":"https://cleantechnica.com/2018/12/23/tesla-the-taxpayer-pravduh-about-subsidies/"}

{"text":"Txhe presentation of Saß’ long awaited, comprehensive work about the legendary music venue “Quartier Latin” gives occasion for an evening of live music and readings. One of the best-know rock, jazz, and blues stages of West Berlin, the new Wintergarten Varieté now occupies the walls of the “Quartier Latin” and will celebrate its precursor with an evening to remember.\nThe evening: Long, overcrowded nights, memorable events, strange stories, but also adversity, crises and ever new solutions. The “Quartier Latin” is brought back to life for a multimedial evening on the very stage that hosted a wild flurry of musicians and artists for almost twenty years during the wild Westberliner years. Through conversation and song, readings and multivisions, the authors of the book will commemorate artists and organisers, operators, guests and all others that worked to give the “Quartier Latin” its unique place in Berlin’s history.\nThe book: A mixture of image and text, with a large number of authentic photographs, documents, impressions and memories on 400 pages; An opulent picture book for friends of the legendary Quartier Latin and all who are curious about the vibrant rock and jazz history of the cultural and counter-cultural metropolis Berlin. With a lot of sympathy for its subject, the book utilizes images, documentation and text to conjure the legendary music venue and its heyday of the 1970s and 80s.\nThe authors: As the son of managers Christa and Manfred “Manne” Saß, Marco Saß experienced the Latin Quarter more directly than anyone else during his teenage years, and captured a wealth of impressions of the popular music venue via classic black&white concert photography. Henry Steinhau, music journalist and cultural editor, experienced more than 100 concerts at the “Quartier Latin” in the 1980s. With a relaxed, cheeky style, he leads through stories and history, narratives and stories, combining experiences and insights. Erik Spiekermann, internationally renowned designer and type designer from Berlin provides the book’s design. Well-known for creating numerous typefaces, such as the modern classic Meta and the BVG house font, as well as founding the international design agencies Metadesign and EdenSpiekermann, Spiekermann was also involved with the “Quartier Latin” in the 1970s. Through his experiences as a musician, designer, and printer of concert posters for the venue, Spiekermann was able to provide a very special contribution that is reflected in the loving design of the book.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T20:26:05Z","url":"https://www.wintergarten-berlin.de/en/show/quartier-latin/"}

{"text":"xNew and old collided Friday at the Cannes Film Festival when one of Silicon Valley's biggest entertainment players visited the bastion of traditional cinema.\nNetflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos took the stage at a venerable Cannes theater to explain the company's strategy, after a year that saw the streaming service move full-on into the original film business.\nHe was received with a mixture of curiosity and, occasionally, hostility, as Netflix essentially issued a call from within the belly of the beast.\nIn the past year, Netflix has grown aggressive on the film front, signing a very pricey deal for a series of movies with Adam Sandler, partnering with the Weinstein Co. to make a \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" sequel and acquiring Cary Fukunaga's finished film \"Beasts of No Nation\" for a planned award-season run.\nThose efforts, greeted warmly by some sales agents and filmmakers for providing another content pipeline, have also been fretted over by many who see Netflix as a threat to a traditional business model they say works just fine.\nFriday's event, under the unusual Cannes billing of \"Next,\" turned most combustible not over issues of viewership figures or theater end-arounds — two of the more controversial issues in the U.S. — but on the question of European tax rebates.\nNetflix's critics have said the company's increased global efforts could put local government-subsidized productions out of business across Europe. After a questioner in the audience took Sarandos harshly to task — he said the Netflix inroads would \"destroy\" the business — the executive fired back.\n\"I don't think that's true,\" Sarandos said, as he referenced Netflix shows such as the local French series \"Marseille.\" \"We won't take one cent of French tax dollars to produce the show. I'm not saying it's negative or positive. I'm saying it [the funds] will be irrelevant because we have a huge global footprint.\"\nThe questioner pushed, and after some more back and forth, Sarandos received a boost from an unlikely ally: Harvey Weinstein. The Weinstein Co. principal was in the front row and came to his feet to defend Netflix, with which he has co-produced both film and television.\n\"They are visionaries,\" he said of Netflix. \"A million people in America watch French-language films\" because of the service, he added, noting that \"I hope the government spends money on hospitals and children. I hope the market is so good [films] don't need government funds.\"\nMany of Sarandos' remarks echo what he and other Netflix executives have been saying for some time: that the current system of \"windowing\" movies (essentially, delaying them until after their theatrical release) was outmoded and needed an overhaul. \"It's just too long. We live in an age when the Internet allows people to watch whatever they want whenever they want. Movies have been ... immune from that. We're trying to change that.\"\nBut if the message was familiar, the venue wasn't.\nCannes is a place where all kinds of industry veterans come — certainly not just high-end directors and cinephiles — to do business at what's informally known as \"the market.\" A sort of trade show that runs in parallel to the auteur screenings and red carpets, the market serves as a bazaar of international rights for many B pictures and below, and its not uncommon to see entertainment industry figures of all stripes in its ranks, including outsiders and upstarts.\nThe two French journalists interviewing Sarandos indeed pushed the issue, but Sarandos emphasized the company's mantra that its streaming-first approach to new films does not preclude theaters from showing movies simultaneously.\n\"Nothing we're doing is meant to be anti-theater or anti-cinema,\" he said. \"People will still go to movies. But I think people want choice, and if you don't give them choice it will only harm\" studios' interests.\nTheater owners have maintained that a system that allows movies to roll out in sequence across platforms remains the gold standard of Hollywood, embraced by consumers and helping to form a reliable business model for both producers and distributors.\nEven more than in television, Netflix has been a smoke bomb to the film business, which relies on a complex set of revenue streams — theatrical but also the DVD, cable and other platforms collectively known as the back-end — to fund movies and recoup profits.\nBut as Sarandos acknowledged Friday, \"there is no back-end\" at Netflix, since the service retains all rights to its content.\nAsked how filmmakers are then compensated, he said it was on the basis of \"what we think the back-end\" would be, though he didn't offer many specifics when asked to explain how the company arrives at that formula.\n\"I know these are not popular sentiments, but this is the reality,\" he said.\nThat the conversation took place at Cannes, a place that has long been the beachhead for the high-end theatrical experience did not go unnoticed by observers, and spoke to how much digital media and traditional cinema are interested in one other, if cautiously.\nAs an institution, Cannes is considered a stalwart advocate of the theater experience and generally takes a more careful approach to digital promotion, especially of the commercial front; unlike most festivals, for example, it's uncommon to see hashtags or other digital exhortations on its screens.\nCannes is, however, a place that embraces independent film, and Sarandos made the case that his company has been a staunch supporter of the form, acquiring the documentaries \"Virunga\" and \"The Square\" and committing to independent scripted features (\"Beasts of No Nation,\" acquired in an expensive deal, fits the bill).\nHe also explained the company's decision not to release viewership numbers to the public or producers — a policy that has angered many in a business that bases decisions on box office and TV ratings — because to do so would subject the company (and in turn lower-performing shows) to undue pressure if they weren't immediately succeeding. The lack of disclosures does means high-quality shows can operate and be renewed free from Wall Street scrutiny, though whether such a reason is motivation for the secretive policy or merely a byproduct of it is a matter of debate.\nWhile there seemed to be no specific agenda, Sarandos generally seemed keen to persuade the Cannes audience that Netflix's foray into film is something the prestige film world shouldn't fear. \"In total, he said, \"the movie business will be bigger, more movies will be made and more movies will be seen.\"","timestamp":"2019-04-18T15:08:04Z","url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-cannes-film-festival-netflix-ted-sarandos-weinstein-20150515-story.html"}

The initial discussion document, released mid last year, ran to 200 pages. The draft Bill is more than twice that length. In between, there have been two hefty Cabinet papers in February and May.\nThe submission deadline is 6 September, with the Ministry of Economic Development (MED) encouraging earlier responses. This is relatively tight, given the sheer volume of the documentation - but there will be an opportunity to submit on the Bill itself in early 2012, once referred to Select Committee.\nChapman Tripp has followed the review closely throughout and will be producing detailed commentaries on key aspects of the draft Bill over the next few days. This Brief Counsel seeks to provide you with a wide angle overview of the Bill and to assist you to navigate the detail. We also provide links to our previous Brief Counsels.\nThe Bill is the centre-piece in what Commerce Minister Simon Power has described as a “once in a generation” reform of capital markets regulation and introduces some fundamental changes in regulatory design.\ncriminal liability for egregious breaches of directors’ duties to act in good faith and in the best interests of the company and in relation to reckless trading.\nMED has published a commentary highlighting areas for submission and providing a road map to the Bill, identifying which sections deal with each area.\nMuch of the technical detail and substance on areas such as disclosure content requirements will be contained in regulations. The Government is promising further “extensive consultation” on these over the coming year. Also still to be drafted are the transitional and consequential amendments to fully implement the new regimes.\nThis is an important opportunity to influence the shape of the Bill which the Government hopes to get into the House in early October, before Parliament is dissolved for the 26 November general election, for enactment early in the next term.\nThe use of exposure draft legislation is particularly appropriate for technical policy areas which require a practical knowledge of what will and will not work in the marketplace. Since the unhappy experience of the financial adviser reforms, the Government has favoured this approach as it reduces the risk of legislative error.\nTo encourage participation, MED plans to hold public stakeholder meetings in tandem with the written submissions. MED will release the meeting schedule shortly.\nFurther decisions in Securities Law Review.

Their album reputation was established by 1979’s ‘Fulham Fallout’, a collection of knockout songs including such gems as teenage anthem ‘I’m On Heat’.","timestamp":"2019-04-26T00:21:27Z","url":"http://www.gigjunkies.com/band-reviews/tag/the-lurkers/"}
